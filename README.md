## Storylens Nodejs Headless CMS

A bit of introduction - [Storylens.io https://storylens.io] is a platform that lets you build a beautiful blog/website without writing much code.

While working on that front, we've decided to open source our backend for the greater good. It's basically a Content Management System written in Node.js, Express, MongoDB with a layer of redis for caching.

### What does it include?

The modules we've developed include
1. Users
2. Story (Publish/edit/delete)
3. Tags
4. Categories
5. Blog Settings
6. Templates
7. Email subscriptions etc.

### What's in the pipeline?
1. Premium Analytics and stats
2. Integrations
3. CLI support for creation of new project


We're in the process of cleaning up our code. We'd love a bit of help from the community before the code is made live. If anyone is interested in looking at the code and giving us a helping hand, we'd definitely appreciate it. Just ping us at dev@storylens.io. We'll add you to the repo.

### When can I see the code here?
We're expecting to finish cleaning up by the first week of May.
