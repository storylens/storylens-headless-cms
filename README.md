A bit of introduction - Storylens.io is a platform that lets you build a beautiful blog/website without writing much code.

While working on that front, we've decided to open source our backend for the greater good. It's basically a Content Management System written in Node.js, Express, MongoDB with a layer of redis for caching.

The modules we've developed include
1. Users
2. Story (Publish/edit/delete)
3. Tags
4. Categories
5. Blog Settings
6. Templates
7. Email subscriptions etc.

We're in the process of cleaning up the code and would love a bit of help from anyone interested.
